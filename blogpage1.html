        Not much I had to give you anything but, I really wanted to do something which could be a little bit useful to you!
        Still IDK this will be or not but atleast it never took anything from me much expensive except a little bit of efforts that I could make ofc.
        I also wanted to say that ki main shayad aaj kuch likh nahi paya but that I do everytime it's a common thing. But this is a new skill that I have learned in the past two years web design and full stack dev which i could make use of to make you feel special.. 
        This is just a demo of a blog kind of section which whatever you wanna turn into you can just ask me I will do.
        At first I didn't even knew that what will I make, write and do when I know close to nothing about you! Still I challenged myself and just thought ki chill hai banate hain let's see the reaction and then will after that ask to fill up whatever or even everthing that I've mentioned here wrong/incorrect about you.. Hope you liked the present and would accept it.. 
        <br>
        Well this is what I have been working on since past two-three days.. This I had a little bit different idea in design from the start I was trying to make it but due to less time I made it simple, my apologies.. I wanted to this a full stack but the backend started showing up some errors while deployment so I decided to show you this before this day ends and I will hand it to you fully functional soon! :)

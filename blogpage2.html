    <h2>Something more that</h2>
    <h1>I want to say</h1>
    
    <p>
       This is something that I had designed for you but due to lack of time It wasn't passible to make this but I will complete this some days. This is just a portfolio and resume kind of website for your future if you apply for jobs and stuff anywhere you can use this. Just tell me the details that I need to change here.. Hope you like this gift. I've also bought a domain name for you.. mind these all are from my freelance earnings so don't worry, party samajh ke lele aur mujhe party kab derahi hai ye jaldi se jaldi confirm karke batao!ðŸ˜‚
        <br>
       Mazak karrha hu.. You're such a nice person to meet and be friends with.. Let's meet soon and hope the college opens soon!  
       Pasand aye to batadena.. Kuch napasand aye to bejhijhak boldena ki ye chiz achci nhi lagrhi I'll redesign it and.. Ek baar tune koi to story daali thi IDK potato ke upar to maine kuch likha tha aise hi faltu bakwas (We writers just write hypothetically 50% imagination and 50% true ðŸ˜‚!) : 
       <br>
       Sometimes it's tired <br>
       Sometimes it's stressed <br>
       Sometimes it needs a hug <br>
       Sometimes it needs a patt on the back.. <br> 
       Sometimes it needs me <br>
       And then we went to sleep <br>
       It woke up one day and started to weep <br>
       I asked what's the matter! <br>
       She replied I don't matter! <br>
       Everyone gets tired of me.. <br>
       Tries me for everything and leaves the true me.. <br>
       I'm nothing but to be used with someone else.. <br>
       Now, I wanna be alone with no one else.. <br>
       Now I hada take this to her and make her understand <br>
       How she's special and how she's so grand <br>
       Everyone wants her to be in their recipie! <br>
       She's the best ingredient not anyone left that easy! <br> 
       She is my favorite with nothing else just like the sweet potato! <br> 
       I love her like sweet and simple but chalega even if she's a dorito! <br>
       And love it added with spices and other ingredients <br>
       She's sweet and simple without any additions <br>
       My opinion is mine her is her's <br>
       It won't make a difference if she love others <br>
       She'll always be my sweet potato <br>
       Used anywhere even in a dorito! <br>
       I love you but more than others do <br>
       You my sweet and even the kindest potato <br>
